# text-editor-app

The task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Coding requirements

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database

## User story

AS A developer

I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection

SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
